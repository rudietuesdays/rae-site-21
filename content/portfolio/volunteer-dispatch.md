This is a fork of a project developed by the Astoria Mutual Aid Network. It creates a Slackbot that sends and receives data to and from AirTable to connect volunteers with community members in need. It is built in JavaScript and utilizes Docker Compose. The code repo can be found [here](https://github.com/throneless-tech/volunteer-dispatch).
