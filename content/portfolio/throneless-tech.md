Throneless Tech is a technology worker-cooperative based in Washington, DC. Throneless specializes in building technology for social justice oriented community organizations, activist groups, and non-profits.

Throneless cooperators are activists and organizers who’ve done work on a variety of issues, including reproductive justice, food justice, gender parity, racial equity and internet freedom. We care as deeply about building responsible, accessible software and websites as we do about the issues and causes we’re building for.

As activists and organizers, Throneless cooperators have experience in all project phases, including collaboration, discovery, revising, and building. We pride ourselves on complete, accessible, responsive work that is long lasting and durable for causes we believe in. We’ll work with you to create the right look and feel for your site or app, valuing your knowledge of your cause and brand with our knowledge of design and code.
